# Prishtina Open Brewery 🍻🔧

## Overview

The **Open Source Brewery** is a research and development initiative dedicated to applying open-source technologies within the brewing industry. Beyond establishing a fully functional nano-brewery where enthusiasts can brew and collaborate, the project serves as an educational and innovation platform. Here, the community explores how technology can transform brewing processes — making them smarter, more accessible, and more efficient.

By embracing open-source principles, all designs, code, prototypes, and brewing recipes are shared freely, empowering individuals and communities to learn, adapt, and contribute to the future of craft brewing.

## Objectives 🎯

- **Democratize Brewing Knowledge**: Make the art and science of brewing accessible to everyone, regardless of experience.
- **Integrate Open Technology**: Develop and implement open-source hardware and software solutions for monitoring, controlling, and optimizing brewing processes.
- **Foster Innovation**: Encourage experimentation and innovation in brewing through collaboration and shared learning.
- **Promote Citizen Science**: Inspire a culture of DIY innovation and community-driven research in the brewing industry.

## Main Components 🏗️

### 🍺 Beer-O-Meter
A custom-built device that:
- **Measures beer flow** precisely through draft lines using flow sensors.
- **Displays real-time dispensing data** on LED matrices.
- **Controls access** to the draft system through **RFID authentication**, enabling user/session-based dispensing.

### 🌡️ Fermentation Maintenance Systems
Prototypes for maintaining and monitoring optimal fermentation conditions:
- **Temperature Sensors**: Continuous monitoring of fermentation chamber temperatures.
- **CO₂ Sensors**: Measuring CO₂ levels to gauge fermentation activity.
- **Automation**: Future integrations will allow automated cooling/heating control based on sensor data.

### 🧠 Machine Learning for Brewing Recipes
Exploratory research on using machine learning algorithms to:
- **Analyze past brewing data** (ingredients, brewing conditions, outcomes).
- **Suggest optimized brewing recipes** based on desired taste profiles or brewing goals.
- **Predict fermentation behavior** and propose dynamic adjustments during brewing or fermentation phases.

## Why Open Source? 🌐

- **Transparency**: All hardware schematics, software code, and brewing recipes are available for public use and modification.
- **Collaboration**: The community is invited to contribute improvements, suggest new ideas, and build on existing prototypes.
- **Education**: By exposing every part of the system — from brewing to sensor electronics to algorithm development — we empower people to learn by doing.
- **Innovation**: Open ecosystems accelerate innovation by enabling rapid prototyping, peer review, and collective problem-solving.
